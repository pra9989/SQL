The SQL ORDER BY
Example
Sort the products from lowest to highest price:

SELECT * FROM Products
ORDER BY Price;

ORDER BY Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;

ORDER BY DESC
 To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.

Example
Sort the products from highest to lowest price:
SELECT * FROM Products
ORDER BY Price DESC;

Order Alphabetically
For string values, the ORDER BY keyword will sort the values in the column alphabetically:
Example
Sort the ProductName column in alphabetically order:
SELECT * FROM Products
ORDER BY ProductName;

Alphabetically DESC
To sort the text values in a column in a descending order, use the DESC keyword:
Example
Sort the ProductName column in descending alphabetically order:

SELECT * FROM Products
ORDER BY ProductName DESC;

ORDER BY Several Columns
The following SQL statement selects all customers from the "Customers" table - and sorts it by the "Country" and the "CustomerName" column.
This means that it sorts it first by Country, and if some records have the same Country, it sorts them by CustomerName:
Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country, CustomerName;


Combine ASC and DESC
The following SQL statement selects all customers from the "Customers" table, and sorts it ASCENDING by the "Country" and DESCENDING by the "CustomerName" column:
Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country ASC, CustomerName DESC;
